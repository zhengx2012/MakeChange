#### How To Run This Project
* Input a value when prompted for price of item. 
* Input the amount you would like to use pay for it in the next prompt.  
* If amount is equal to the price, computer will output a line.
* If amount is less than the price, you will be prompted to add additional value.
* System will print the change in the amount of bills and coins.
* The main method will print the initial message for user input.
* The cashRegister method will collect the user inputs and calculate the remainder needed to give back to the user.
* The billCalc method will take the remainder and output bills.
